<h3>I made a page with Jekyll.</h3>
<img src="grilled mac and cheese.jpg" alt="Grilled mac and cheese">
This is the content of the page. All <em>HTML</em> can be included. Since the layout uses bootstrap we can also include <span class="text-danger">Bootstrap classes</span>.
<p> This is a: {{ page.category }} type page </p>
